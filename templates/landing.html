            The Haggle platform allows users to leverage their social data and "haggle" for a personalised price. To allow people to be able to do this, we:
        </p>
        <ul class="developers-list">
            <li>Have crawlers which fetch restaurant info from various social networks</li>
            <li>We harmonize and cache this information in our datastore to be able to quickly mine user preferences</li>
            <li>We allow users to leverage their social data on Facebook, Foursquare and Twitter</li>
            <li>Our nightly jobs pull all users' data from these networks harmonize them and mine for patterns in this data</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
            Through the Haggle platform we have now made all this available to you!<br>
            Read on, to figure out how you can get all the Haggle awesomeness integrated with your app.
